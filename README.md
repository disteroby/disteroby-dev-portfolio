# Roberto Di Stefano's Portfolio! 🚀

Hi and welcome to my online portfolio!

I'm thrilled to have you here and share with you my journey as a developer. This portfolio is not just a showcase of my work; it's a reflection of my *passion* for coding, my *dedication* to mastering new technologies, and my commitment to delivering high-quality projects.


## Exploring the Project

Within this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my projects, each crafted with **care** and **attention to detail**. From sleek web applications to interactive experiences, every project represents a unique challenge and an opportunity for growth. I believe in pushing the boundaries of *creativity* and *innovation*, and I hope my portfolio reflects that ambition.


## Embracing Modern Technologies

In developing this portfolio, I've utilized a diverse range of cutting-edge technologies to bring my vision to life. From the dynamic capabilities of **React** and **Typescript** to the sleek design elements of **Tailwind CSS**, every tool serves a purpose in creating a *seamless user experience*. **Firebase** empowers me to manage data efficiently, while **WebGL (Three.js - React Three Fiber)** adds a touch of immersive 3D magic. With **Framer Motion**, I bring animations to life, adding flair and personality to each interaction.


## Setting Up the Project

Ready to dive in and explore my portfolio on your own machine? Let me guide you through the setup process:

1. Make sure you have **React version 18.2.0** or higher and **npm version 9.6.7** or higher installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/disteroby/disteroby-dev-portfolio.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory and install all dependencies by running:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. In the repository, you will find a file named [default.env](default.env). Copy this file and rename it to `.env`.

5. After creating a new project on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and setting up a [Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), fill in the `.env` file with your own configuration.

6. Now, fire up the project locally by running:
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer, you can start the optimized build version locally with:
   ```shell
   npm run build:preview
   ```
